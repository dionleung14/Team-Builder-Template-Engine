## Created by Dion Leung

### Summary of this documentation

This .md document (README.md) will describe features in the CLI app Team-Builder-Template-Engine and in all supporting files. 
* Features of app1.js 
* Features of the .js files in the lib folder
* Additional comments and notes

### Features of app1.js
This app1.js is a direct copy of the included app.js. It appears as if app.js was corrupted in some way, so the code was copied over to the copy app1.js. It utilizes a series of functions that fire dependent on the input received from the user via the inquirer package. Although the inquirer prompts require that a manager fill out the forms, a malicious actor could lie and fill out the roster under the pretense of being a manager.

### Features of the .js files in the lib folder
The various .js files in the lib folder were constructed with their corresponding test suites in mind. As such, all of the parameters and methods use the pre-existing names that the test suites ask for.

### Additional comments and notes
Attempts were made to make the code as dry as possible and compartmentalize different employee prompts. Further drying could be done with a generic employee inquirer prompt that receives name, id, and email.
